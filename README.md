# Uber Ride Cancellations Analysis

## Objective
Identify the key reasons for Uber ride cancellations and analyze their impact on overall revenue. Provide actionable insights to improve driver availability, reduce cancellations, and optimize revenue.

## Tools Used
- MS Excel: for exploratory data analysis and visualization
- MySQL: for querying, cleaning, and aggregating booking-level data
- Power BI: for interactive dashboards and trend analysis

## Key Findings
- Out of 150,000 bookings, 62% were successful, with an average ride value of ₹508.
- Revenue opportunity:
  - Potential increase of 10% through improved driver availability
  - Potential increase of 38% if failed rides are converted into successful trips
- Time Analysis:
  - Two time windows (4 hrs and 6 hrs) account for 86% of net revenue
  - Peak hours (5–7 PM) alone contribute 23% of total revenue
- Trend Analysis: Monthly performance remains consistent, indicating structural challenges in ride matching and availability

## Business Impact
- Dynamic driver allocation during peak hours can reduce missed rides
- Targeted incentives for drivers in high-demand periods can lower cancellations
- Improved matching algorithms can increase completed rides and revenue

## Summary
The analysis provides a clear understanding of ride cancellations and revenue loss. Implementing the suggested strategies could significantly improve ride completion rates and overall revenue.
